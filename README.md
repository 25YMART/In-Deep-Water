# In Deep Water: Flood Modelling in the Singapore context
A flooding simulation with WebGL Overlay View, deployed with Vercel. This model predicts floods in Singapore based on natural events like rain and storm. It also takes into account the magnitude to which certain regions will be affected based on population density, cost of damages, and the presence of important infrastructure using the onemap API from https://www.onemap.gov.sg/
